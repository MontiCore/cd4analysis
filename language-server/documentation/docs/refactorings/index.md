# Overview

Code actions are a feature of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) that allows the editor to suggest and apply changes to the document based on the userâ€™s selection or context.
The following refactorings are available as CodeActions:

- [Collapse Hierarchy](actions/collapse_hierarchy.md)
- [Extract Superclass](actions/extract_superclass.md)
- [Pull Up Field](actions/pull_up_field.md)
- [Unfold attributes](actions/unfold_attributes.md)

The design of the CodeActions is discussed in the section [Extending CodeActions](actions/code_action_extension.md).
